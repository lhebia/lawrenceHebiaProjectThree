//On document ready, load a randomly generated 4 * 4 grid of card tiles

// When the user clicks a card, the card changes appearance to show an element to match - store this user selection in a variable

// When the user clicks on a second card, a function runs to check for a match between the current selection and the previously selected card

    // If this card matches the initial stored card
        // Hide both cards and add 1 to the card pair counter variable
    // If the cards do not match, flip them both to hide the “front” of each one

// After each try, a check for winner function will run to see if the pair counters have reached the total pairs on the deck

// If there is a winner, a message will dynamically be added to the page
